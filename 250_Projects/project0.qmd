### Introduction

_THIS `.qmd` IS INSTRUCTIONAL AND SHOULD `NOT` BE USED TO WRITE YOUR REPORTS (EXCEPTION - PROJECT 0). THERE IS ANOTHER TEMPLATE FILE FOR THAT. YOU WILL NEED TO `PREVIEW` THE REPORT TO PRODUCE A `.html` FILE. YOU WILL SUBMIT THE `.html` FILE ON CANVAS._

```{python}
#| label: libraries
#| include: false
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from lets_plot import *

LetsPlot.setup_html(isolated_frame=True)
import pandas as pd
from lets_plot import *

# Set up LetsPlot for rendering
LetsPlot.setup_html()
```



## Elevator pitch
_A SHORT (2-3 SENTENCES) PARAGRAPH THAT `DESCRIBES KEY INSIGHTS` TAKEN FROM METRICS IN THE PROJECT RESULTS THINK TOP OR MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS._ (Note: this is not a summary of the project, but a summary of the results.)

_A Client has requested this analysis and this is your one shot of what you would say to your boss in a 2 min elevator ride before he takes your report and hands it to the client._

The analysis of the Palmer Penguins dataset shows a clear positive relationship between flipper length and body mass across Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo species. This distinction helps separate penguin species based on their physical attributes, providing a useful method for field researchers and ecologists to monitor and classify penguin populations efficiently. These insights could also contribute to predictive models for species identification in wildlife conservation.

```{python}
#| label: project-data
#| code-summary: Read and format project data

# Learn morea about Code Cells: https://quarto.org/docs/reference/cells/cells-jupyter.html

# Include and execute your code here
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byuidatascience/data4python4ds/master/data-raw/mpg/mpg.csv")

#| label: project-data
#| code-summary: Read and format project data

# Load the penguins data from the CSV file
penguins = pd.read_csv("penguins.csv")

# Drop rows with missing values
penguins_clean = penguins.dropna()

# Display the first few rows of the cleaned dataset to verify
penguins_clean.head()

```

__Highlight the Questions and Tasks__

## Question|Task 1

__COPY PASTE QUESTION|TASK 1 FROM THE PROJECT HERE__

_Add details here to answer the question but `NOT` like an assignment Q&A. You need to `write your answers as a consulting solution report`. A Client needs to understand the answer, but also needs to understand the decisions that went into the answer (when applicable)._


```{python}
#| label: Q1
#| code-summary: Read and format data
# Include and execute your code here
#| label: Q1-chart
#| code-summary: plot example
#| fig-cap: "Body mass vs flipper length by species"
#| fig-align: center

# Create a scatter plot for body mass vs flipper length, colored by species
ggplot(penguins_clean, aes(x='flipper_length_mm', y='body_mass_g', color='species', shape='species')) + \
    geom_point() + \
    ggtitle("Body mass and flipper length of Penguins") + \
    xlab("Flipper length (mm)") + \
    ylab("Body mass (g)") + \
    theme_minimal()


```

## Question|Task 2

__COPY PASTE QUESTION|TASK 2 FROM THE PROJECT HERE__

- _include figures in chunks and discuss your findings in the figure._

```{python}
#| label: Q1-chart
#| code-summary: plot example
#| fig-cap: "My useless chart"
#| fig-align: center
# Include and execute your code here

(ggplot(df.head(500), aes(x='displ', y='hwy')) + geom_point()
)
```

## Question|Task 3

__COPY PASTE QUESTION|TASK 3 FROM THE PROJECT HERE__

- _PROVIDE TABLES THAT HELP ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS AND TASKS (IF APPLICABLE)._

```{python}
#| label: Q1-table
#| code-summary: table example
#| tbl-cap: "table example"
#| tbl-cap-location: top
# Include and execute your code here
#| label: Q1-table
#| code-summary: table example
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics of penguin species"
#| tbl-cap-location: top

# Example of summarizing the penguins dataset by species
penguin_summary = penguins_clean.groupby('species').agg({
    'flipper_length_mm': 'mean',
    'body_mass_g': 'mean'
}).reset_index()

# Display the summary table
penguin_summary
